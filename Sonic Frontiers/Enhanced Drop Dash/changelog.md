## Enhanced Drop Dash - Version 2.0.0
- A semi-complete rewrite of Enhanced Drop Dash with stability improvements, new features and more polished ideas.
- The old "Stomp Dash" as you know it is now "Quick Stomp Dash".
- Added a ***new*** "Stomp Dash" that will now let you drop dash when landing from a stomp. Stomp, drop and roll!
- Added a ***new*** "Air Dash" that will let you drop dash in mid-air by charging a regular drop dash and boosting (this is the intended successor to what is now "Quick Stomp Dash").
- Added a separate velocity threshold to "Quick Stomp Dash" to allow you to configure it separately for 2D sections.
- Added an option to require air boost to perform a "Quick Stomp Dash".
- You can now set each of the additional moves to work only on islands, in Cyber Space or in both worlds.
- There is now a "Grounded" uncurl mode that will uncurl Sonic when he hits the ground when performing either an "Air Dash" or a "Quick Stomp Dash".
- Fixed drop dash getting stuck in 2D sections when holding the analog stick towards or away from the 2D plane camera.

It is recommended that you use the **Retain Ground Velocity for Jump** code with this update.
