## Enhanced Moveset - Version 3.0.0-lite
- **This is a work-in-progress version of Enhanced Moveset, the new direction for Enhanced Drop Dash.**
- **This build features a limited selection of new additions to Enhanced Moveset**, these are subject to change or have been limited until the final release.
- Notable new additions;
  - **Air Tricks:** performing Air Tricks will now reward Sonic with boost, this is a complete feature, but is mainly intended for use with something coming in the final release.
  - **Spin Boost:** added the option to always start tricks when exiting out of Spin Boost whilst ungrounded, as well as the ability to uncurl immediately when releasing LT to spam Spin Boost in succession. There's a lot more to come in the final release.
  - **Spin Charge:** added camera shake options, ported the Sonic Lost World control scheme and added various improvements to its behaviour. The ability to actually charge a Spin Dash and make a difference in speed will come in the final release.
  - **Spin Move:** added enhanced physics that allow Sonic to naturally roll down slopes, this can be activated via LT from a standstill in this build, but there will be other ways of activation in the final release.
- Air Dash and Quick Stomp Dash remain unchanged from Enhanced Drop Dash.
- Stomp Dash has been removed in favour of Sonic Team's addition of stomping through Spin Charge.
- You can now configure the mod whilst the game is running and see your changes live.

- Added a separate velocity threshold to "Quick Stomp Dash" to allow you to configure it separately for 2D sections.
- Added an option to require air boost to perform a "Quick Stomp Dash".
- You can now set each of the additional moves to work only on islands, in Cyber Space or in both worlds.
